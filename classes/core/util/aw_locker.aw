	/** locks the specified resource
		@attrib api=1 params=pos

		@param class required type=string
			Class of the resource to lock

		@param id required type=int
			Id of the resource to lock

		@param type required type=int
			One of aw_locker::LOCK_FULL (blocks reading AND writing) or aw_locker::LOCK_WRITE (blocks just writing)

		@param boundary required type=int
			Sets the lock boundary - aw_locker::BOUNDARY_SERVER (just this server) aw_locker::BOUNDARY_PROCESS (just this process on this server) aw_locker::BOUNDARY_SESSION -- this server for current session

		@param wait_type required type=int
			Default waiting type on the lock - aw_locker::WAIT_BLOCK (blocks until the lock is released) or aw_locker::WAIT_EXCEPTION (throws exception aw_lock_exception if the lock is held)

		@param release_time type=float default=0
			UNIX "microtimestamp" time the lock is held until. Default 0 means indefinitely or until lock is explicitly released with unlock()

		@comment
			Locks the resource with the given identifier (class and id).

		@examples
			process one:
				aw_set_exec_time(AW_LONG_PROCESS);
				$locker = aw_locker::instance();
				$locker->lock("object", 12, aw_locker::LOCK_WRITE, aw_locker::BOUNDARY_SERVER, aw_locker::WAIT_BLOCK);

				sleep(5);

				$locker->unlock("object", 12);

			process two:
				try {
					aw_locker::try_operation("object", 12, aw_locker::OPERATION_READ, aw_locker::WAIT_EXCEPTION);
				}
				catch(aw_lock_exception $e)
				{
					echo "Resource is locked!";
				}
				echo "Resource available!";

			if run in parallel, the second process throws an exception
