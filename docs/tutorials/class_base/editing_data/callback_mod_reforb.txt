<h2>callback_mod_reforb</h2>

can be used to modify the reforb data in the generated form. Common use of this is to add some hidden fields, but definining a "hidden" property might be a better way accomplish this.

#php#
function callback_mod_reforb($arr,$request)
{
	if ($this->subgroup)
	{
		$arr["subgroup"] = $this->subgroup;
	};
}
#/php#

The optional second argument contains request data, which you cannot modify of course
