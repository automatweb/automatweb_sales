<h2>radiobutton</h2>

Radiobutton. Quite useless as a separate property type but can be used in callback properties.

<b>value</b>

    Value is handled a differently from other property types, it's not shown, but if the radiobutton is checked, you'll get that as the value of the property

<b>rb_value</b>

    If equal to value, the radiobutton will be checked
