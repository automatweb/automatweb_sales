Function and class names

Function and class names must not be capitalized and words should be saparated with underscores. Words should not be abbreviated, but completely spelled out, unless that makes the name rediculously long. 

examples:

class CWrongName - not ok
class cwrongname - not ok
class cwrngnm - not ok
class correct_name - ok

function MkWizardPage - not ok
function makewizardpage - not ok
function mkwzpg - not ok
function make_wizard_page - ok
