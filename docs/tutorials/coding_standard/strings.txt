Rules for strings in aw code:

1) All strings in the code that reach the end user MUST BE called via the t() function, like this:

$t->define_field(array(
	"caption" => t("Created By")
));

2) You MUST NOT insert multi-line strings in one t() call, the .po format cannot handle that. You must put each line as a separate entry in the t() function, like this:

$long_text = t("First line")."\n";
$long_text .= t("Second line");


3) You MUST NEVER EVER write any accented characters into the strings, you MUST USE their respective entities (&auml; and so on)

4) You must NOT write strings into templates that are used in the admin side, all the strings in those should come from the code as VAR:'s, so that they can be translated in one place. Of course, the admin interface should not use many templates anyway, so that should not be a problem for the few that do. Mostly vcl components.
