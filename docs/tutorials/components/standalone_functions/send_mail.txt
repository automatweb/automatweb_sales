send_mail($to,$subject,$msg,$headers)

Instead of the PHP mail() function use this if you need to send
mail from your class/application. This way all the outgoing messages
go through a single code path, which makes it easy to put
any additonal headers into the message or do some other or
change the way sending mail works.

For example, in some situations it may be required to send
mail through a SMTP server. If that need raises then it
will be implemented in this function instead of changing
code in tens of places.

Returns nothing
