warnings

Warings are used mostly to notify user about empty properties among these propvalues that were queried during last request. Also they can be used manually from code for specific warnings.

Warnings are shown if their level exceeds user specified level. Every property has a default warning level 1 (except relpicker which has 2, and checkboxes etc which have 0). These warning levels can be overrided from property definition, for example:

@property foo type=textbox warning=4
@caption bar

In user object, there is a 'warning level show' property, so user can set the level from where he/she wants to see the warnings. for example when a property has a warning level 4 and user sets his level to4, he sees warning. when user sets his level to 6, he doesn't. simple as that.

From code warnings can be used through static warning($msg, $level) function, where $msg is the warning message and $level is the warning level. warning level is optional, with default value 1.

Warnings are shown on the AW UI aside backfeed, help etc buttons(at least for now)
